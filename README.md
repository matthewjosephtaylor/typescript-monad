# MJT Typescript Monad

Some simple and handy things for creating / working with [Monads](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(functional_programming)>) in Typescript

## Why?

This module is half learning exercise / half opinions of how I want these
things to behave in my Typescript environment.

Like a Jedi having to craft his own lightsaber, it seems those who go down
the FP path must at some point craft the classic Monads for themselves.

## Warning

There are many libraries for dealing with javascript in an FP way. I would
highly recommend checking those out for 'production work'.

Feel free to inspect this code and use if desired, however note that I will
certainly update this project without warning as my knowledge/opinions change.

This is a 'working' module (module I include in my work) which does not attempt
to follow any rules regarding semver. _I_ trust it but make no guarantees.
